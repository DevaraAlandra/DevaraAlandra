Nice to meet you! I'm Andra. <br/>

🧙‍♂️ I'm a 17-year-old tech wizard, pursuing my Honours in Artificial Intelligence. <br/>

🚀 My love for computer science has set me on an exciting journey through the realms of Machine and Deep Learning, with a special focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Guided by grace, I'm driven by a strong curiosity to explore the complexities of AI, both in theory and in real-world applications. <br/>

⚗️ Lately, I've been working with Tensorflow, PyTorch, and GAN Image Generation projects while trying to balance a hefty school life. <br/>

Other than tweaking neural networks, I'm either hardstuck reading webnovels, roaming around the Altus Plateau, or immersing myself in my newest obsession, Gunpla Model Building! <br/>
